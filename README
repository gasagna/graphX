Thank you for testing this beta version of graphX!

Before installing you should have installed in your 
system some dependencies. On Ubuntu run this command 
in a terminal to get all the required stuff:
  
  sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-numpy

Then, to install graphX run:
  
  sudo python setup.py install

You should then be able to launch graphX from the 
command line.
